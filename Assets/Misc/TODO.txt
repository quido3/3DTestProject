For the cutting

Slicing needs a effect. Sound and some part flying

Slicing needs collider for the enemies

Slicing needs to work without looking at parts

First and last vector calculating for the trail

Sliced part to disappear

Sliced part to join the mass

DONE - Slicing generates the new piece like shit. Center points is the original center

PROBLEM - The second vertice of the last triangle is wrong for some reason. Only when slicing "backwards". Last vertice is at the opposite side because of the trail added there
				Happen on both sides. Need to set it to some of the closest closest3 or something
